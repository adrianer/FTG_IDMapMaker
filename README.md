### For the Glory ID Map Maker

This program runs on an installation of either For the Glory or Europa Universalis II and is capable of taking the raw map files and generating an image like the following:

![ID map](FTG ID Map.png?raw=true)

This can be useful for modders who need to edit game events or scenarios and don't want to have to have a copy of the game running at all times.
